# Prolog_Ai_chatbot-


% Problem 5 (Recursion with read-write loop)

% Implement a predicate, chat, that replies like a simple chatbot 
% to a word the user types in, & stops when the user types stop.
% See the sample dialog below. You can invent your own chatbot
% replies, but they should incorporate the user's word.
% Implement the interactive loop using recursion.

% Sample dialog:
% ?- chat.
% hello I am a chatbot
% when you see "user:" type a word followed by "."
% or type "stop." if you want to stop this nonsense!
% user: hello.
% Who likes hello?
% user: everyone.
% What is everyone?
% user: nothing.
% Do you like nothing?
% user: yes.
% Could you please stop talking about yes?
% user: ok.
% Could you please stop talking about ok?
% user: stop.
% true.
